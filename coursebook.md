1. Download the Dataset
   dataset is downloaded and the file is extracted under the UCI HAR Dataset folder
   
2. Assigning each data to variable
   features <- features.txt : 
   The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
   activity <- activity_labels.txt : 
   List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
   subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt :
   contains test data of volunteer test subjects being observed
   x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 
   contains recorded features test data
   y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 
   contains test data of activities’code labels
   subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt :
   contains train data of volunteer subjects being observed
   x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 
   contains recorded features train data
   y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 
   contains train data of activities’code labels
   
 
3.Merging the dataset
   X is used to merge X_test and X_train
   Y is used to merge Y_test and Y_train
   subject is used to merge subject_train and subject_test
   merged_data is a variable in which all merged data (subject,X,Y) is stored
   

4. Extracting the mean and std from the measurement

   data is a variable in which mean and std containing file is extracted
   
5. labeling the data set with data  names 
   for "S.no" to "Activity"
   for "Acc"" to "Acclerometer"
   for"Mag" to "Magnitude"
   every line starting with f changing into "frequency"
   
6. Final data
   
   final data is generated by grouping the data on the basis of subject and Activity and then summarising the data to get mean 
   of the given data.
   finaldata file name = "finaldata.txt"
